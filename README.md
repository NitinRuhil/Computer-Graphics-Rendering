# Computer Graphics Rendering Project

This repository contains a complete Computer Graphics project that demonstrates the core concepts of 2D and 3D graphics rendering using C and C++.
The project focuses on building and visualizing geometric shapes, transformations, and basic rendering techniques.

The goal of this project is to show how low-level graphics concepts are implemented using programming and mathematical models.

## Project Overview

This project covers the full pipeline of basic computer graphics, including:

* Drawing 2D and 3D shapes
* Applying transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
* Implementing viewing and projection techniques
* Understanding how objects are represented and displayed on screen

Each module in the repository represents a part of the rendering and visualization process.
